## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that helps ice cream vendors or businesses anticipate sales based on weather conditions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and historical sales data, the project provides insights into the expected ice cream sales for a given day, allowing businesses to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing information about historical ice cream sales, including factors like temperature, humidity, and day of the week. The dataset is stored in a CSV file format.

## Evaluation

The project's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics assess the accuracy of the ice cream sales predictions.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please submit an issue or a pull request. Let's collaborate to make this project even better.
